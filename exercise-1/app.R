# Exercise 1: Building a user interface

# Load the `shiny` package (install it in the R terminal if you haven't already)
library(shiny)

# Define a new `ui` variable. This variable should be assigned a `fluidPage()`
# layout, which should be passed the following:

ui <- fluidPage(
    h1("First Shiny Website"),
    p("This is my first website written using", strong("Shiny")),
    img("", src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/l3q2Ip7FrmPE33EiI/giphy.gif"),
    p("this is a paragraph about a", em("slider")),
    sliderInput(
        "slider",
        "My First Slider", min = 0, max = 100, value = 50, step = 10
    )
)

server <- function(input, output){}
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

  # A top level header: "First Shiny Website"


  # A Paragraph, describing your excitement: include some `strong` text


  # An image with this `src`
  # https://media2.giphy.com/media/l3q2Ip7FrmPE33EiI/giphy.gif


  # Another paragraph about a slider: include some `em` text


  # A slider with an appropriate label, min of 10, max of 100, value of 50



# Define a `server` function that accepts an input and an output
# At this point, don't do anything in the function
# This function should perform the following:



# Create a new `shinyApp()` using the above ui and server
